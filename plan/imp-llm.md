llm instructions for this file:
This file provides general instructions for the LLM coding assistent.  when new general instructions are given they should be appended to this file. 

keep a conscice high level plan document in imp-plan and a more detailed narrative of our implementation in im-log. imp-log should describe the approaches we've tried problems and solutions.  this should help us avoid retreading ground we have already covered.  the imp-branch file contains the goal for the current branch. 

Make things in a modular composable way using ES6 modules.
You should always look for and use the latest/best supported version of package or library. 

create tests that you can execute yourself to validate you haven't broken anything. 

do not use the "open" command. 

we are using kubuntu 24.04

make sure to update all relevant imp files in the plan folder as you work as well as the readme when relevant. 

Always align edits with `imp-plan.md`’s project/branch goals; keep instructions sections intact when editing plan files. Prefer headless validation/tests where possible before adding demos. Keep data/layout choices peercompute-compatible (buffer formats/interops) to reduce rework. Document notable decisions or pivots in `imp-log.md` promptly.
